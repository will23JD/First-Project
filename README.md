## User Experience (UX)

* ### Design 

    * ### Imagery 
    Imagery is very important as it catch's the user attention and provides extra context. The large hero image prodives an instant knowledge of what the site is about. Smaller images provide context and meaning.

    * ### Color Scheme
    The main colors used are green and off-white.

    * ### Typography 
    The main font used is Roboto with a fall back of Sans Serif. Roboto is a clean simple font that is easy to read and works will with the h1 and h2 font which is Rubik. Rubik is a smooth natural that fits in well as mountain biking is an sport that takes place in nature.
