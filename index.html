I love riding my bike but doing it with a group of people, all with a love for it, makes it so much better.

            <p>
                Retro Bike is all about enjoying time on your bike but things can go wrong some times so here are some things you must do to keep yourself safe on the trail.
            </p>
            <ul id="requ-list">
                <li>
                    Always wear a helmet
                </li>
                <li>
                    Appropiate mountain bike clothing. This will offer a lot more protection over normal clothes in the event of a crash and against the elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the later months September - December it starts to get dark, so bring a  mountain bike light (we recommend one for your handle bars and one for your helmet).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Everyone is at different skill levels, so if you don't feel comfortable with a section of trail then don't worry just get off and walk it. Or if you feel up to the challenge then just ask a more experienced rider for some help.
